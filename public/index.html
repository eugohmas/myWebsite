                <P>this is a summary all about how my life got turned upside down. I'd like to take a minute to let you in, let me tell you how I became the father of my twins. You can go back even further in the timeline below but for now, let's start in march of 2022. That is when the twins were born which led me to be a stay at home dad in June of 2022. From there, I started to consider my future and my past 8 years as a protective relay engineer. I realized that the power industry was not conducive to a healthy family life in our situation. I decided to get into web development. I had done plenty of coding before but most of it was unstructured, unorganized, and for a singular purpose which made it lack decent code layout techniques.</P>

            <p> I was born in 1992 which makes me a crazy millenial, if I am not mistaken. I was born in Connecticut where I lived until 2008 with my family. During my childhood, I loved to take things apart to figure out how they worked, although, at that time, I struggled to put them back together. I also loved to be outdoors and on the computer. I am the third of 4 kids, three of which are boys and one girl. I played soccer and hockey up until highschool. Then I decided to just play hockey in highschool. In middle school and highschool, I found myself both excelling and enjoying math and science because I had a drive to problem solve. This ultimately led me to choose electrical engineering for a college major.

            <p> In 2008, my family moved to Bozeman, Montana. I finished my highschool years in Montana. I enjoyed skiing, hiking, mountain biking, and camping as much as I could during these years. My parents also enjoyed these activities so we got to do them as a family as well. I worked construction , as well as at a subway and a taco time during this period.
