        <p>
          This is a summary all about how my life got turned upside down. I'd
          like to take a minute to let you in, let me tell you how I became the
          father of my twins. You can go back even further in the timeline below
          but for now, let's start in march of 2022. That is when the twins were
          born which led me to be a stay at home dad in June of 2022. From
          there, I started to consider my future and my past 8 years as a
          protective relay engineer. I realized that the power industry was not
          conducive to a healthy family life in our situation. I decided to get
          into web development. I had done plenty of coding before but most of
          it was unstructured, unorganized, and for a singular purpose which
          made it lack decent code layout techniques.

        My wedding was one of the most memorable days of my life. I married the
        woman of my dreams and it was the start of the greatest adventure I have
        ever embarked on. We were lucky enough to have friends and family to
        celebrate with us and enjoyed good food and some fun dancing.

        Lilly was born. Lilly is our first born and was a challenging baby. She
        has changed our world for the better. It has been an amazing journey
        learning how to parent her and will continue to be wonderful growing
        with her as a part of our family. She was born in July of 2020 and it
        already seems like she is growing up too fast. I love spending quality
        time with my kids.

        The twins were born in march of 2022. We were not expecting to have
        twins but here we are. Cameron and Ezekial were born two months early
        and spent almost that amount of time in the NICU. We thought we had this
        parenting thing down until the twins came along. They have shown us what
        a true lack of sleep lifestyle actually looks like while making us love
        them more and more each day.

        My life revolves mostly around my family now, but the kids are starting
        to get into more and more activities. When we are not out with the kids,
        we can often be found at home playing board games or reading books. I
        also spend a large amount of time taking care of our old house and
        trying to keep the current project list at bay.
